## How to run

Clone the repo, then run:

This command will install dependencies listed in **package.json**

After installing, run:

## Dev note

When making changes, you must recompile **.js** files. In order to do this, run:

```
$ npm run compile
```

Another option is run

```

This option will auto-compile **.js** files while making changes.

Don't forget to run **npm start** or refresh Electron after editing and compiling.
